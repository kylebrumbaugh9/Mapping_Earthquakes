# Mapping_Earthquakes

Man! This was a fun one. Once it clicked, I finally understood it but this was really neat. The purpose of this assignment was to plot all the earthquakes that have occurred in the last 7 days onto a world map and visualize the magnitude of them in different ways. 

I was able to make pull data from GeoJSON files from multiple places, format multiple layers of a map, and display the earthquake data properly. This project felt really good!
